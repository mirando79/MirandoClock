### P.S.

  I am a "former" sound engineer. I studied music and even worked in a choir (lyric baritone),
    all my life I have been "fascinated" by esotericism and there is no direction in which
    I would not be knowledgeable. Now there is a war in my country. And this is very sad.
    I need a job and I began to master and search for what, where and how, since there is no reason to exist.
    This project is (God willing!) the beginning of the program "Self-Stalking".
    SS - is an abbreviation for "self stalking". The plans are to create an application for people who are really
    "into the subject of esotericism and magic". It should include blocks and glossaries,
    so that it would be possible to "find a common language",
    perhaps it will "grow" into another platform and help people understand tarot,
    runes, ogama, astrology, bagua i-ching, tantra and telema, new age channeling, etc.
    In parallel, I am currently compiling a song ("with meaning") to raise the Spirit of our soldiers on the front lines.
    So I will not refuse cooperation (remixes on the theme) and interaction in space Ableton.
    I wish everyone creative inspiration, Love, Light, Reason and Awareness!
